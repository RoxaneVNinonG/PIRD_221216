The repository presents the implementation of a new multi-criteria analysis procedure. This new procedure allows to integrate the fluctuation of the data into the method in order to obtain more robust results using Monte Carlo principle. The multi-criteria analysis method used in this report is ELectre Tri. This new procedure is applied to a case study of energy renovation of a building (Daniel, 2022). 

The repository contains:
- The "Technical Report" is the implementation of a new Multi Criteria analysis procedure. This procedure allows the use of input data distributions to integrate the uncertainty of the data into the process using Monte Carlo principle. In this implementation the new procedure is coupled with the multi-criteria analysis method ELECTRE Tri. In order to implement it, this procedure is applied to the choice of the best energy renovation scenario for a set of three buildings.
- "Input_Data" is a csv file containing all the data necesaary for the project. These data were retrieved by Souleymane Daniel as part of his thesis where he applied Electre Tri individually to this project. 
- The environment of the implementation
- The figures used in the report
